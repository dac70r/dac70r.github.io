memory leak every time addThing is called.

addThing works with help of another function which uses dynamic memory but has no way to deallocate.

To solve the problem:

ditch the function completely, create pointers on the spot and deallocate memory on the spot

after use.

to achieve that, i may have to rewrite the addThing function, the whole program too..

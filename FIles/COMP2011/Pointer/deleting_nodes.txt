scenario 

1. empty list
check if head==nullptr is yes then it is empty else not empty use if-statements

2. delete beginning first node
first node is not head 

if head == current
head = current->next;
head = head->next;

delete current;

3. search for node to be deleted
need another one pointing to the previous node

ll_node = *prev = nullptr;
*current = head;

while(current!=nullptr && current->data != c){
    prev = current;
    current = prev->next;
}

skipping the note to be deleted
prev->next = current->next

delete current;



4. delete at the back

if(current->next = nullptr;)

previous->next = current->next

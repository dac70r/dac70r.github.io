/////adding nodes:

////empty list? 
////beginning of the list?
////end of the list?
/////between two nodes?


///adding a node to an empty list
///to add a node:
///step one : create a node
///store the address in new_node pointer
///head = new_node


///insert a node at the beginnning (at position 0)
///create a node
///new_node pointer pointing to the new node
///update 
/// new_node->next = head->next //new node's next now points to head's next (which is initially the node next to head)
///update head to point the new node
///head = new_node


///insert in between 
/// need some search operation
/// create a new node with pointer pointing to the new node
/// find the node to inserrt new node behind of eg. find p, insert node behind p 
/// first step is to link new node to the node 'behind'  the new node
/// new_node->next = p->next
/// linking new node to the one before it which is p
/// p-> next = new_node
///

////insert at the last 
/// create newnode 
///search operaation
// p here is the last node
// p->next = new_node
//new_node -> nullptr

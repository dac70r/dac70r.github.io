Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[7] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[7]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#1 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between LED_reg[7]_i_2/I0 and LED_reg[7]_i_2/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#2 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between LED_reg[7]_i_3/I1 and LED_reg[7]_i_3/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#3 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between LED_reg[7]_i_4/I2 and LED_reg[7]_i_4/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>
